<!-- 1. Testimonials
● Upon clicking the "Next" or "Previous" buttons, the testimonial displayed
will transition to the next or previous one accordingly.
● The navigation is cyclic, meaning that when the user reaches the final
testimonial and clicks the "Next" button, the first testimonial will appear.
Similarly, if the user is viewing the first testimonial and clicks the
"Previous" button, the last testimonial will be displayed.
● Next, try to implement an infinite testimonial loop that automatically
changes every 3 seconds using setInterval.
You can utilize the provided dummy data to populate and display the
testimonials on the webpage. -->
